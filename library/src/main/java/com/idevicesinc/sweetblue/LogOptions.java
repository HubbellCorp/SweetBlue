 * logs that have to do with SweetBlue logic, the other are "native" logs, which print when SweetBlue receives any callbacks from the
 * native stack. Each of these two types can then specify the log level to be printed (Use {@link LogLevel} to pick with ones you would like
 * to see).
 *
 * You can also use {@link #OFF} to shut all logging off, {@link #ON} to turn on most helpful logs, and {@link #ALL_ON} to turn all logging on for convenience (this one can
 * cause performance issues during scanning, as it will print a log every time a device is seen).
