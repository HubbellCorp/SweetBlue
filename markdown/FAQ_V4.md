### What are the changes from version 3?

* SweetBlue has been open sourced for v4
* The API key is no longer needed, and any code relating to it has been removed (`BleManager.createInstance()` is the only method that has been removed, as it's no longer needed)
* The SweetBlue Toolbox source code is now included! The app is a complete app, showing more of a real world scenario than simple hello world apps (we have those too, though)

### What is SweetBlue licensed under now?

* SweetBlue is now licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE.txt) for version 4 and beyond
